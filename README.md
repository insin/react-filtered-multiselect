A `<FilteredMultiSelect/>` React component, for making and adding to selections using a filtered multi-select.

[Live example with Bootstrap styles applied](http://insin.github.io/react-filtered-multiselect/)

## Features

This component manages an `<input>`, a `<select multiple>` and a `<button>`.

You provide a list of objects to be used to populate the select and an `onChange` callback function.

Typing in the the input will filter the select to items with matching option text.

When some of the select's options are selected, the button will become enabled. Clicking it will select the objects backing the currently selected options.

If only one option is displayed after filtering against the input, pressing Enter in the input will select the object backing it.

When backing objects are selected, the `onChange` callback is executed, passing a list of all backing objects selected so far.

To hide already-selected items, pass them back to `FilteredMultiSelect` as its `selectedOptions` prop. This can be more convenient than manually removing the selected items from the list passed as `options`.

To deselect items, remove them from the list passed back via the `onChange` callback and re-render the `FilteredMultiSelect` with the new list passed as its `selectedOptions` prop.

Double-clicking will add the selected option to the selection.

## Install

**Node**

````
npm install react-filtered-multiselect
```

```javascript
var FilteredMultiSelect = require('react-filtered-multiselect')
// or

```

**Browser**

Browser bundles export a global ``FilteredMultiSelect`` variable and expect to find a global ``React`` variable to work with.

## API

### Required props

Minimal usage:

```javascript
var options = [
  {value: 1, text: 'Item One'},
  {value: 2, text: 'Item Two'}
]

<FilteredMultiSelect
  onChange={this.handleChange}
  options={options}
/>
```

`options` - list of objects providing `<option>` data for the multi-select. By default, these should have ``text`` and ``value`` properties, but this is configurable via props.

The component will update its display if its `options` list changes length or is replaced with a different list, but it will *not* be able to detect changes which don't affect length or object equality, such as replacement of one option with another. Consider using `react-addons-update` or other immutability helpers if you need to do this.

`onChange(selectedOptions)` - callback which will be called with selected option objects each time the selection is added to.

### Optional props

`buttonText` - text to be displayed in the `<button>` for adding selected `<option>`s.

`className` - class name for the component's `<div>` container.

`classNames` - class names for each of the component's child elements. See the default props below for properties. Defaults will be used for any properties not specified via this prop.

`defaultFilter` - default filter text to be applied to the `<select>`

`disabled` - disables each child element if `true`.

`placeholder` - placeholder text to be displayed in the filter `<input>`.

`selectedOptions` - list of option objects which are selected, so should no
longer be displayed in the `<select>`.

`size` - `size` attribute for the `<select>`

`textProp` - name of the property in each object in `options` which provides
the displayed text for its `<option>`.

`valueProp` - name of the property in each object in `options` which provides
the `value` for its `<option>`.

### Default props

```javascript
{
  buttonText: 'Select',
  className: 'FilteredMultiSelect',
  classNames: {
    button: 'FilteredMultiSelect__button',
    // Used when at least one <option> is selected
    buttonActive: 'FilteredMultiSelect__button--active',
    filter: 'FilteredMultiSelect__filter',
    select: 'FilteredMultiSelect__select'
  }
  defaultFilter: '',
  disabled: false,
  placeholder: 'type to filter',
  size: 6,
  selectedOptions: [],
  textProp: 'text',
  valueProp: 'value'
}
```

## Example

Example which implements display of selected items and de-selection.

```javascript
var CULTURE_SHIPS = [
  {id: 1, name: '5*Gelish-Oplule'},
  {id: 2, name: '7*Uagren'},
// ...
  {id: 249, name: 'Zero Gravitas'},
  {id: 250, name: 'Zoologist'}
]

var Example = React.createClass({
  getInitialState() {
    return {selectedShips: []}
  },

  handleDeselect(index) {
    var selectedShips = this.state.selectedShips.slice()
    selectedShips.splice(index, 1)
    this.setState({selectedShips})
  },
  handleSelectionChange(selectedShips) {
    this.setState({selectedShips})
  },

  render() {
    var {selectedShips} = this.state
    return <div>
      <FilteredMultiSelect
        onChange={this.handleSelectionChange}
        options={CULTURE_SHIPS}
        selectedOptions={selectedShips}
        textProp="name"
        valueProp="id"
      />
      {selectedShips.length === 0 && <p>(nothing selected yet)</p>}
      {selectedShips.length > 0 && <ul>
        {selectedShips.map((ship, i) => <li key={ship.id}>
          {`${ship.name} `}
          <button type="button" onClick={this.handleDeselect.bind(null, i)}>
            &times;
          </button>
        </li>)}
      </ul>}
    </div>
  }
})
```
